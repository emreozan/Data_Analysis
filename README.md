# Data Analysis
Here, the scripts that I write for certain tasks can be seen. They are usually repetitive things that I write by hand. These give brief overviews regarding the data.

[Csv_Analysis](https://github.com/emreozan/Data_Analysis/blob/main/CSV_Analysis.ipynb): 

A small function to make very basic overview of the dataset. The questions it gives answers to:

- How many rows and columns does the file have
- What are the dataypes of the columns
- How many columnd have missing values
- What are the names of the columns with missing values, how many missing values do they have, what is the percentage of the missing values and the dataypes of the columns with missing values
